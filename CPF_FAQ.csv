- Your savings which you have applied to reserve in your Ordinary Account before your 55th birthday. This reserved amount 1  will not be transferred to your Retirement Account. Hence, you can continue to use it to pay your housing loan after turning 55 years old. To reserve your Ordinary Account savings, please log on using your Singpass to my cpf Online Services > Click on “My Requests” > Select “Retirement (eg. Retirement Sum & Age 55 applications)” > Select ""Decide on my CPF options for members reaching 55"";

- Your new CPF contributions to your Ordinary Account (if you continue working after 55).
